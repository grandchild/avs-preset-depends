## AVS Preset Depends

A CLI tool to scan Winamp AVS presets for any files it might need.

Scan individual files or whole directories.


### Build

Install Rust & Cargo, then:

```shell
cargo build --release
```


### Usage

For each path (either file or directory) the tool will print out a sectioned list of
resources the preset(s) wants to use.

```shell
target/release/preset-depends preset.avs
# or
target/release/preset-depends ~/Winamp/Plugins/avs/Me/MyPack/
```

If you pass multiple paths, it will output separate lists for each path.


#### Example Output

```shell
‚ùØ preset-depends \
    "~/Winamp/Plugins/avs/zamuz - visions five/" \
    "~/Winamp/Plugins/avs/VISBOT/VC017/01 skupers - same old intro.avs"
```
```yaml
/home/me/Winamp/Plugins/avs/zamuz - visions five:
  Images:
    - v4_texer7.bmp
    - v5_texer1.bmp
    - v5_circle.bmp
    - V5_intro4.bmp
    - v5_square.bmp
    - V5_intro2.bmp
    - v5_circle2.bmp
  APEs:
    - Channel Shift
    - Color Map
    - "Holden04: Video Delay"
    - "Holden03: Convolution Filter"
    - "Acko.net: Texer II"
/home/me/Winamp/Plugins/avs/VISBOT/VC017/01 skupers - same old intro.avs:
  Images:
    - vb.bmp
  APEs:
    - Color Map
    - "Holden03: Convolution Filter"
```


### Todo

- Translate APE ID strings into `.ape` filenames if available.
- Make precompiled releases downloadable
- Allow setting a `Winamp/Plugins/avs` base-dir to find and print full paths for
  available and warnings for missing files


### Learning Rust

While this project does serve a useful purpose, it is with _equal_ importance a project
for learning Rust. I try hard to make the code as idiomatic as possible and to apply
various parts of the language and libraries. For example the `IterableEnum` trait
sub-crate is borderline unnecessary but taught me a bit about how to write macros. The
code should have minimal dependencies and produce the smallest possible binary size.
