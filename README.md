## AVS Preset Depends

[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~grandchild.svg?search=avs-preset-depends)](https://builds.sr.ht/~grandchild?search=avs-preset-depends)

A CLI tool to scan Winamp AVS presets for any files it might need.

Scan individual files or whole directories.


### Build

Install Rust & Cargo, then:

```shell
cargo build --release
```


### Usage

```
Usage: preset-depends [<path...>] [-w <winamp-dir>] [-c]

For each path (either file or directory) print out a sectioned list of resources
the preset(s) depend on.

Positional Arguments:
  path              path(s) to preset files or directories.

Options:
  -w, --winamp-dir  path to Winamp base directory, if given will resolve
                    filenames for many resources including images and APE plugin
                    files. also tolerates if you pass paths to `Winamp/Plugins`
                    or `Winamp/Plugins/avs`.
  -c, --count       collect preset counts for each resource. note multiple uses
                    in one preset still only count as one.
  --help            display usage information
```


#### Example Output

```shell
‚ùØ preset-depends \
    "~/Winamp/Plugins/avs/zamuz - visions five/" \
    "~/Winamp/Plugins/avs/VISBOT/VC017/01 skupers - same old intro.avs"
```
```yaml
/home/me/Winamp/Plugins/avs/zamuz - visions five:
  Images:
    - v4_texer7.bmp
    - v5_circle.bmp
    - v5_circle2.bmp
    - V5_intro2.bmp
    - V5_intro4.bmp
    - v5_square.bmp
    - v5_texer1.bmp
  APEs:
    - "Acko.net: Texer II"
    - Channel Shift
    - Color Map
    - "Holden03: Convolution Filter"
    - "Holden04: Video Delay"
/home/me/Winamp/Plugins/avs/VISBOT/VC017/01 skupers - same old intro.avs:
  Images:
    - vb.bmp
  APEs:
    - Color Map
    - "Holden03: Convolution Filter"
```


### Todo

- ~~Try retrieving resources `async`.~~
    - Done in the
      [concurrent](https://github.com/grandchild/avs-preset-depends/tree/concurrent) branch.
    - Speedup: ~1.3x
    - Binary size: +20%
    - Code complexity: One more function, and a split between file collection and
      resource gathering.
- Unit- & integration testing
- CI & downloadable release builds


### Learning Rust

While this project does serve a useful purpose, it is with _equal_ importance a project
for learning Rust. I try hard to make the code as idiomatic as possible and to apply
various parts of the language and libraries. Other than that the code should have
minimal dependencies and produce the smallest possible binary size.
